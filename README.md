# Welcome to Flutter-Mini-Apps

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I am the admin of Instagram page [@theflutterway](https://www.instagram.com/theflutterway/).

I share my Learning around Flutter and  Mobile APP Developement.

I once asked my audience what do they want and most of the Content ideas people suggested were around 3 major topics :
1 StateManagement (with provider)
2 working with different APIs
3 Animations  (little-little things that improves the UI)

  ...and then we planned this MiniApps Series , making working apps covering all three concerns above.
and we started our journey ðŸš€.
