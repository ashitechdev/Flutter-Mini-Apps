More Feature Ideas you can add

   that is internationalization 
   just use this package [country_code_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/country_code_picker)

- add dummy + user defined  quick messages 
   (like - 'hello' , 'I am Ashish' , 'Hey This is my WhatsApp')
   use any offline DB [hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) or [sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite)

- make a list of history of messages sent 
   (and statuses - failed or suceed)

- adding media files sharing support
    just get the file address and use [share](https://pub.dev/packages/share) plugin for Flutter

- let Users play around with API by creating custom WhatsApp message links 
   (you might be aware of this - when you tap on a link and it redirects to you WhatsApp with a PreDefined Message)
